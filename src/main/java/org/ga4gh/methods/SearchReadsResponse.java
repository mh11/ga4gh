Unlike the\\n  `SEQUENCE_MATCH` and `SEQUENCE_MISMATCH` operators, the `ALIGNMENT_MATCH`\\n  operator does not indicate whether the reference and read sequences are an\\n  exact match. This operator is equivalent to SAM's `M`.\\n* `INSERT`: The insert operator indicates that the read contains evidence of\\n  bases being inserted into the reference. This operator is equivalent to\\n  SAM's `I`.\\n* `DELETE`: The delete operator indicates that the read contains evidence of\\n  bases being deleted from the reference. This operator is equivalent to\\n  SAM's `D`.\\n* `SKIP`: The skip operator indicates that this read skips a long segment of\\n  the reference, but the bases have not been deleted. This operator is\\n  commonly used when working with RNA-seq data, where reads may skip long\\n  segments of the reference between exons. This operator is equivalent to\\n  SAM's 'N'.\\n* `CLIP_SOFT`: The soft clip operator indicates that bases at the start/end\\n  of a read have not been considered during alignment. This may occur if the\\n  majority of a read maps, except for low quality bases at the start/end of\\n  a read. This operator is equivalent to SAM's 'S'. Bases that are soft clipped\\n  will still be stored in the read.\\n* `CLIP_HARD`: The hard clip operator indicates that bases at the start/end of\\n  a read have been omitted from this alignment. This may occur if this linear\\n  alignment is part of a chimeric alignment, or if the read has been trimmed\\n  (e.g., during error correction, or to trim poly-A tails for RNA-seq). This\\n  operator is equivalent to SAM's 'H'.\\n* `PAD`: The pad operator indicates that there is padding in an alignment.\\n  This operator is equivalent to SAM's 'P'.\\n* `SEQUENCE_MATCH`: This operator indicates that this portion of the aligned\\n  sequence exactly matches the reference (e.g., all bases are equal to the\\n  reference bases). This operator is equivalent to SAM's '='.\\n* `SEQUENCE_MISMATCH`: This operator indicates that this portion of the\\n  aligned sequence is an alignment match to the reference, but a sequence\\n  mismatch (e.g., the bases are not equal to the reference). This can\\n  indicate a SNP or a read error.
