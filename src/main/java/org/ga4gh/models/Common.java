##Sequences, Segments, and References

A sequence is a component in a sequence graph, optionally joined at its ends to
other sequences. Sequences are not directly retrievable through the API, but
ranges of their bases can be downloaded.

A `Segment` is a range on a sequence, possibly including the joins at the
sequence's ends. It does not include base data. When you ask about the novel
sequences that come in a `VariantSet`, you will get back `Segment`s covering
them. A `Path` through a sequence graph is a list of `Segment`s.

A `Reference` (defined in references.avdl) is an object that marks a sequence as
part of a `ReferenceSet`'s sequence graph. It contains a `Segment` covering the
sequence it belongs to.

##Sequence Graph Concepts

Many of the types defined here are related to defining sequence graphs. Sequence
graph concepts can be illustrated on a piece of double-stranded DNA with two
nicks in it, one on the top strand and one on the bottom strand. Here is an
example where the top strand is GGTGGNG.

```
            | <- top strand nick at position (2,+)
5' -------  -------------------  3'
     G   G   T   G   G   N   G
     C   C   A   C   C   N   C
3' ----------------  ----------  5'
                  | <- bottom strand nick at position (3,-)

    +0- +1- +2- +3- +4- +5- +6- <- coordinates
```

A sequence is a piece of double-stranded DNA composed of a series of DNA
basepairs. In the default forward orientation a sequence is specified by the DNA
letters of its top strand, e.g. in this case GGTGGNG, where N indicates an
unknown base. The basepairs are indexed left to right from 0 to 6 relative to
this default orientation.  A sequence containing regions of uncertainty, denoted
by Ns, is called a scaffold, while a sequence in which every base is known is
called a contig. This sequence is a scaffold.

In its default forward orientation, each basepair has a left or "+" side and a
right or "-" side. For example, the left side of the T/A basepair in the above
example lies immediately to the left of this basepair. The left side of the T/A
basepair is represented by the position (2,+), where the index 2 is the same as
that of the basepair itself, and the "+" confirms that we mean the default
forward orientation. The right side is indicated using the "-" orientation. For
example, the right side of the following G/C base pair is represented by the
position (3,-).

One way to think about a position in a sequence is to imagine that the DNA
double helix is nicked, as shown above. When double stranded DNA is nicked, the
5'-3' phosphodiester bond between two adjacent bases on one strand is broken,
leaving  an exposed phosphate group on the 5' side, shown by the vertical bar
(and an exposed hydroxyl group on the 3' side, not shown). From a chemical point
of view, you can think of a position in a sequence as the the location in the
double-stranded DNA of the exposed 5' phosphate group created by a nick. The
position (2,+) is the exposed phosphate group of the top strand nick in the
diagram above, and the position (3,-) is the same thing in  the bottom strand
nick.

Each nonempty sequence has a "start", which is the left side of the first
basepair, and an "end", which is the right side of the last basepair. Each
sequence has associated, possibly null, "start join" and "end join" positions,
which indicate sides from other sequences that have been observed participating
in phosphodiester bonds with the start and end, respectively, of this sequence.
The sequence carrying the join is the "child", while the sequence on which the
join is positioned is the "parent"; parent-child relationships are constrained
to be acyclic. If a sequence with a start join and end join contains no
basepairs, it represents a phosphodiester bond directly between the start join
and end join sides.

We use collections of segments to describe subgraphs of sequence graphs. A set
of segments can describe an arbitrary sequence subgraph, while an ordered list
of segments can describe a path through a sequence graph.

A segment consists of a start position on a sequence, and a distance along that
sequence (implying an end position). The length is interpreted by traversing the
base of the position first, so a segment that starts on a right side will be
read right to left, along the bottom strand of the sequence. If a segment begins
at the start or end of a sequence, it can have a start join equal to the start
join or end join of its sequence, respectively. Similarly, a segment that ends
at the start or end of its sequence can carry an end join.

For example, the graph consisting of just the sequence in the above example can
be described as follows with a single segment:

```
Segment with top strand GGTGGNG in the reference sequence:
startJoin = null
start = (0,+)
length = 7
end = (6,-)
endJoin = null
```

Now suppose the DNA given above were broken into 3 parts, and repaired in a new
configuration such that the middle piece is inverted and a new C/G basepair is
inserted at the first break, so the result would look like this:

```
            |   |       |
5' -------  --  ------  -----------  3'
     G   G   C   C   A   G   N   G
     C   C   G   G   T   C   N   C
3' --------  --  ------  ----------  5'
          |   |       |
    +0- +1-  ?  -3+ -2+ +4- +5- +6- <- coordinates
```

We would like to take the original sequence graph given above, and extend it
with additional sequences to also describe this new observed variation.

Since the added C/G basepair is novel DNA, an additional reference sequence must
be defined to carry it. Let us call the existing GGTGGNG reference sequence
"ref" and the new reference sequence "nov1". Thus, the new reference sequence
"nov1" looks like

```
    "ref": "nov1":  "ref":

      - 3' 5' -  3' 5' -
 ...  G       C        C  ...
 ...  C       G        G  ...
      - 5' 3' -  5' 3' -

     +1-     +0-      -3+   <- coordinates
```

In other words, it is a 1-basepair sequence, with a start join to the "-" side
of "ref"'s basepair at coordinate 1, and an end join to the "-" side of "ref"'s
basepair at coordinate 3.

The subgraph of our new sequence graph involving "nov1" can be described as a
single segment:

```
Segment with top strand C in the "nov1" reference sequence:
startJoin = (1,-), "ref"
start = (0,+)
length = 1
end = (0,-)
endJoin = (3, -), "ref"

```

To describe the other new phosphodiester bonds that need to be added to the
graph, between (2,+) and (4,+) in "ref", we need to create a new reference
sequence which contains no basepairs at all; it is the empty sequence of DNA
basepairs. Let the reference sequence "nov2" be such a reference sequence, with
start and end joins set to describe these bonds. The reference sequence "nov2"
has no coordinates, and no positions. It looks like this

```
    "ref": "nov2":  "ref":

      - 3' 5'    3' 5' -
 ...  A                G  ...
 ...  T                C  ...
      - 5' 3'    5' 3' -

     -2+              +4-   <- coordinates
```

A reference sequence with only start and end joins is describable by a segment
with only start and end joins. A segment from the "nov2" reference sequence
would look like this:

```
Segment with empty top strand in the "nov2" reference sequence:
startJoin = (2,+), "ref"
start = null
length = 0
end = null
endJoin = (4,+), "ref"
```
All its information will be in its startJoin and endJoin values.

Defined by their top strands, we now have three reference sequences:

```
ref:    GGTGGNG
nov1:   C
nov2:   (empty)
```

Each has its own 0-based coordinate system, although the coordinate system for
"nov2" is empty.

The sequence graph formed by these three sequences is described by the following
set of segments:

```
1. Segment with top strand GGTGGNG in the "ref" reference sequence:
startJoin = null
start = (0,+)
length = 7
end = (6,-)
endJoin = null

2. Segment with top strand C in the "nov1" reference sequence:
startJoin = (1,-), "ref"
start = (0,+)
length = 1
end = (0,-)
endJoin = (3,-), "ref"

3. Segment with top strand empty in the "nov2" reference sequence:
startJoin = (2,+), "ref"
start = null
length = 0
end = null
endJoin = (4,+), "ref"
```

It looks like this:

```
      --C--
     |     |
=G==G==T==G==G==N==G=
      |     |
       -----
```

In this graph, there are two paths from (0,+) on "ref" to (6,-) on the same
sequence. One of them proceeds directly along "ref", and represents the un-
rearranged condition, while one detours through "nov1" and "nov2", and
represents the new configuration of double-stranded DNA that results from the
inversion of the middle piece of "ref" and the insertion of the new basepair
from "nov1".

The un-rearranged path is describable by a list of a single segment:

```
Segment with top strand GGTGGNG in the "ref" reference sequence:
startJoin = null
start = (0,+)
length = 7
end = (6,-)
endJoin = null
```

It looks like this:

```
      --C--
     |     |
=G>=G=>T=>G=>G>=N>=G>
      |     |
       -----
```

The rearranged path is describable by a list of 5 segments, 3 of which are the
contiguous pieces of the "ref" sequence, and 2 of which describe the newly added
"nov1" and "nov2" sequences:

```
1. Segment with top strand GG in the "ref" reference sequence:
startJoin = null
start = (0,+)
length = 2
end = (1,-)
endJoin = null

2. Segment with top strand C in the "nov1" reference sequence, joined to parent
"ref":
startJoin = (1,-), "ref"
start = (0,+)
length = 1
end = (0,-)
endJoin = (3,-), "ref"

3. Segment with top strand TG in the "ref" reference sequence:
startJoin = null
start = (3,-)
length = 2
end = (2,+)
endJoin = null

4. Segment with top strand empty in the "nov2" reference sequence, joined to
parent "ref":
startJoin = (2,+), "ref"
start = null
length = 0
end = null
endJoin = (4,+), "ref"

5.  Segment with top strand GNG in the "ref" reference sequence:
startJoin = null
start = (4,+)
length = 3
end = (6,-)
endJoin = null
```

It looks like this:

```
      --C>-
     ^     |
=G>=G=<T=<G==G>=N>=G>
      |     ^
       -->--
```

Notice that we always maintain the coordinate system on the reference sequence.
The inverted middle segment is specified as starting at a position corresponding
to a nick in the bottom strand of the reference sequence, and continuing on 2
basepairs in a right-to-left direction along the reference sequence. It does not
get new coordinates relative to its final orientation or position in the
rearranged conformation. Also, all of the novel adjacencies in the sequence
graph involve actual novel segments, even if some of these are empty. This is
good for bookkeeping; we want to be able to keep the parent sequences constant
and add new child sequences to express new variants. Overall, this scheme allows
us to create sequence graphs describing any number of configurations and
reconfigurations of reference DNA sequences, and to describe paths through those
graphs representing particular arrangements. */

##Sequences, Segments, and References

A sequence is a component in a sequence graph, optionally joined at its ends to
other sequences. Sequences are not directly retrievable through the API, but
ranges of their bases can be downloaded.

A `Segment` is a range on a sequence, possibly including the joins at the
sequence's ends. It does not include base data. When you ask about the novel
sequences that come in a `VariantSet`, you will get back `Segment`s covering
them. A `Path` through a sequence graph is a list of `Segment`s.

A `Reference` (defined in references.avdl) is an object that marks a sequence as
part of a `ReferenceSet`'s sequence graph. It contains a `Segment` covering the
sequence it belongs to.

##Sequence Graph Concepts

Many of the types defined here are related to defining sequence graphs. Sequence
graph concepts can be illustrated on a piece of double-stranded DNA with two
nicks in it, one on the top strand and one on the bottom strand. Here is an
example where the top strand is GGTGGNG.

```
            | <- top strand nick at position (2,+)
5' -------  -------------------  3'
     G   G   T   G   G   N   G
     C   C   A   C   C   N   C
3' ----------------  ----------  5'
                  | <- bottom strand nick at position (3,-)

    +0- +1- +2- +3- +4- +5- +6- <- coordinates
```

A sequence is a piece of double-stranded DNA composed of a series of DNA
basepairs. In the default forward orientation a sequence is specified by the DNA
letters of its top strand, e.g. in this case GGTGGNG, where N indicates an
unknown base. The basepairs are indexed left to right from 0 to 6 relative to
this default orientation.  A sequence containing regions of uncertainty, denoted
by Ns, is called a scaffold, while a sequence in which every base is known is
called a contig. This sequence is a scaffold.

In its default forward orientation, each basepair has a left or "+" side and a
right or "-" side. For example, the left side of the T/A basepair in the above
example lies immediately to the left of this basepair. The left side of the T/A
basepair is represented by the position (2,+), where the index 2 is the same as
that of the basepair itself, and the "+" confirms that we mean the default
forward orientation. The right side is indicated using the "-" orientation. For
example, the right side of the following G/C base pair is represented by the
position (3,-).

One way to think about a position in a sequence is to imagine that the DNA
double helix is nicked, as shown above. When double stranded DNA is nicked, the
5'-3' phosphodiester bond between two adjacent bases on one strand is broken,
leaving  an exposed phosphate group on the 5' side, shown by the vertical bar
(and an exposed hydroxyl group on the 3' side, not shown). From a chemical point
of view, you can think of a position in a sequence as the the location in the
double-stranded DNA of the exposed 5' phosphate group created by a nick. The
position (2,+) is the exposed phosphate group of the top strand nick in the
diagram above, and the position (3,-) is the same thing in  the bottom strand
nick.

Each nonempty sequence has a "start", which is the left side of the first
basepair, and an "end", which is the right side of the last basepair. Each
sequence has associated, possibly null, "start join" and "end join" positions,
which indicate sides from other sequences that have been observed participating
in phosphodiester bonds with the start and end, respectively, of this sequence.
The sequence carrying the join is the "child", while the sequence on which the
join is positioned is the "parent"; parent-child relationships are constrained
to be acyclic. If a sequence with a start join and end join contains no
basepairs, it represents a phosphodiester bond directly between the start join
and end join sides.

We use collections of segments to describe subgraphs of sequence graphs. A set
of segments can describe an arbitrary sequence subgraph, while an ordered list
of segments can describe a path through a sequence graph.

A segment consists of a start position on a sequence, and a distance along that
sequence (implying an end position). The length is interpreted by traversing the
base of the position first, so a segment that starts on a right side will be
read right to left, along the bottom strand of the sequence. If a segment begins
at the start or end of a sequence, it can have a start join equal to the start
join or end join of its sequence, respectively. Similarly, a segment that ends
at the start or end of its sequence can carry an end join.

For example, the graph consisting of just the sequence in the above example can
be described as follows with a single segment:

```
Segment with top strand GGTGGNG in the reference sequence:
startJoin = null
start = (0,+)
length = 7
end = (6,-)
endJoin = null
```

Now suppose the DNA given above were broken into 3 parts, and repaired in a new
configuration such that the middle piece is inverted and a new C/G basepair is
inserted at the first break, so the result would look like this:

```
            |   |       |
5' -------  --  ------  -----------  3'
     G   G   C   C   A   G   N   G
     C   C   G   G   T   C   N   C
3' --------  --  ------  ----------  5'
          |   |       |
    +0- +1-  ?  -3+ -2+ +4- +5- +6- <- coordinates
```

We would like to take the original sequence graph given above, and extend it
with additional sequences to also describe this new observed variation.

Since the added C/G basepair is novel DNA, an additional reference sequence must
be defined to carry it. Let us call the existing GGTGGNG reference sequence
"ref" and the new reference sequence "nov1". Thus, the new reference sequence
"nov1" looks like

```
    "ref": "nov1":  "ref":

      - 3' 5' -  3' 5' -
 ...  G       C        C  ...
 ...  C       G        G  ...
      - 5' 3' -  5' 3' -

     +1-     +0-      -3+   <- coordinates
```

In other words, it is a 1-basepair sequence, with a start join to the "-" side
of "ref"'s basepair at coordinate 1, and an end join to the "-" side of "ref"'s
basepair at coordinate 3.

The subgraph of our new sequence graph involving "nov1" can be described as a
single segment:

```
Segment with top strand C in the "nov1" reference sequence:
startJoin = (1,-), "ref"
start = (0,+)
length = 1
end = (0,-)
endJoin = (3, -), "ref"

```

To describe the other new phosphodiester bonds that need to be added to the
graph, between (2,+) and (4,+) in "ref", we need to create a new reference
sequence which contains no basepairs at all; it is the empty sequence of DNA
basepairs. Let the reference sequence "nov2" be such a reference sequence, with
start and end joins set to describe these bonds. The reference sequence "nov2"
has no coordinates, and no positions. It looks like this

```
    "ref": "nov2":  "ref":

      - 3' 5'    3' 5' -
 ...  A                G  ...
 ...  T                C  ...
      - 5' 3'    5' 3' -

     -2+              +4-   <- coordinates
```

A reference sequence with only start and end joins is describable by a segment
with only start and end joins. A segment from the "nov2" reference sequence
would look like this:

```
Segment with empty top strand in the "nov2" reference sequence:
startJoin = (2,+), "ref"
start = null
length = 0
end = null
endJoin = (4,+), "ref"
```
All its information will be in its startJoin and endJoin values.

Defined by their top strands, we now have three reference sequences:

```
ref:    GGTGGNG
nov1:   C
nov2:   (empty)
```

Each has its own 0-based coordinate system, although the coordinate system for
"nov2" is empty.

The sequence graph formed by these three sequences is described by the following
set of segments:

```
1. Segment with top strand GGTGGNG in the "ref" reference sequence:
startJoin = null
start = (0,+)
length = 7
end = (6,-)
endJoin = null

2. Segment with top strand C in the "nov1" reference sequence:
startJoin = (1,-), "ref"
start = (0,+)
length = 1
end = (0,-)
endJoin = (3,-), "ref"

3. Segment with top strand empty in the "nov2" reference sequence:
startJoin = (2,+), "ref"
start = null
length = 0
end = null
endJoin = (4,+), "ref"
```

It looks like this:

```
      --C--
     |     |
=G==G==T==G==G==N==G=
      |     |
       -----
```

In this graph, there are two paths from (0,+) on "ref" to (6,-) on the same
sequence. One of them proceeds directly along "ref", and represents the un-
rearranged condition, while one detours through "nov1" and "nov2", and
represents the new configuration of double-stranded DNA that results from the
inversion of the middle piece of "ref" and the insertion of the new basepair
from "nov1".

The un-rearranged path is describable by a list of a single segment:

```
Segment with top strand GGTGGNG in the "ref" reference sequence:
startJoin = null
start = (0,+)
length = 7
end = (6,-)
endJoin = null
```

It looks like this:

```
      --C--
     |     |
=G>=G=>T=>G=>G>=N>=G>
      |     |
       -----
```

The rearranged path is describable by a list of 5 segments, 3 of which are the
contiguous pieces of the "ref" sequence, and 2 of which describe the newly added
"nov1" and "nov2" sequences:

```
1. Segment with top strand GG in the "ref" reference sequence:
startJoin = null
start = (0,+)
length = 2
end = (1,-)
endJoin = null

2. Segment with top strand C in the "nov1" reference sequence, joined to parent
"ref":
startJoin = (1,-), "ref"
start = (0,+)
length = 1
end = (0,-)
endJoin = (3,-), "ref"

3. Segment with top strand TG in the "ref" reference sequence:
startJoin = null
start = (3,-)
length = 2
end = (2,+)
endJoin = null

4. Segment with top strand empty in the "nov2" reference sequence, joined to
parent "ref":
startJoin = (2,+), "ref"
start = null
length = 0
end = null
endJoin = (4,+), "ref"

5.  Segment with top strand GNG in the "ref" reference sequence:
startJoin = null
start = (4,+)
length = 3
end = (6,-)
endJoin = null
```

It looks like this:

```
      --C>-
     ^     |
=G>=G=<T=<G==G>=N>=G>
      |     ^
       -->--
```

Notice that we always maintain the coordinate system on the reference sequence.
The inverted middle segment is specified as starting at a position corresponding
to a nick in the bottom strand of the reference sequence, and continuing on 2
basepairs in a right-to-left direction along the reference sequence. It does not
get new coordinates relative to its final orientation or position in the
rearranged conformation. Also, all of the novel adjacencies in the sequence
graph involve actual novel segments, even if some of these are empty. This is
good for bookkeeping; we want to be able to keep the parent sequences constant
and add new child sequences to express new variants. Overall, this scheme allows
us to create sequence graphs describing any number of configurations and
reconfigurations of reference DNA sequences, and to describe paths through those
graphs representing particular arrangements. */
