/** This file defines the objects used to represent a hierarchy of reads and alignments:

ReadGroupSet >--< ReadGroup --< fragment --< read --< alignment --< linear/graph alignment

* A ReadGroupSet is a logical collection of ReadGroup's.
* A ReadGroup is all the data that's processed the same way by the sequencer.
 There are typically 1-10 ReadGroup's in a ReadGroupSet.
* A *fragment* is a single stretch of a DNA molecule. There are typically
 millions of fragments in a ReadGroup. A fragment has a name (QNAME in BAM
 spec), a length (TLEN in BAM spec), and an array of reads.
* A *read* is a contiguous sequence of bases. There are typically only one or
 two reads in a fragment. If there are two reads, they're known as a mate pair.
 A read has an array of base values, an array of base qualities, and alignment
 information.
* An *alignment* is the way alignment software maps a read to a reference.
 There's one primary alignment, and can be one or more secondary alignments.
 Secondary alignments represent alternate possible mappings.
* A *linear alignment* maps a string of bases to a reference using a single
 CIGAR string. There's one representative alignment, and can be one or more
 supplementary alignments. Supplementary alignments represent linear or graph
 alignments that are subsets of a chimeric alignment.
* A *graph alignment* maps a string of bases to a `Path` through references
 along reference adjacencies using a single CIGAR string. There's one
 representative alignment, and can be one or more supplementary alignments.
 Supplementary alignments represent linear or graph alignments that are subsets
 of a chimeric alignment.
* A ReadAlignment object is a flattened representation of the bottom layers
 of this hierarchy. There's exactly one such object per *linear alignment* or
 *graph alignment*. The object contains alignment info, plus fragment and read
 info for easy access. */

This operator is equivalent to\\n  SAM's `D`.\\n* `SKIP`: The skip operator indicates that this read skips a long segment of\\n  the reference, but the bases have not been deleted. This operator is\\n  commonly used when working with RNA-seq data, wher","e reads may skip long\\n  segments of the reference between exons. This operator is equivalent to\\n  SAM's 'N'.\\n* `CLIP_SOFT`: The soft clip operator indicates that bases at the start/end\\n  of a read have not been considered during alignment.

This may occur if this linear\\n  alignment is part of a chimeric alignment, or if the read has been trimmed\\n  (e.g., during error correction, or to trim poly-A tails for RNA-seq). This\\n  operator is equivalent to SAM's 'H'.\\n* `PAD`: The pad operator indicates that there is padding in an alignment.\\n  This operator is equivalent to SAM's 'P'.\\n* `SEQUENCE_MATCH`: This operator indicates that this portion of the aligned\\n  sequence exactly matches the reference (e.g., all bases are equal to the\\n  reference bases). This operator is equivalent to SAM's '='.\\n* `SEQUENCE_MISMATCH`: This operator indicates that this portion of the\\n  aligned sequence is an alignment match to the reference, but a sequence\\n  mismatch (e.g., the bases are not equal to the reference).
